# Messages : Collaborative Inbox

Messages is the all-in-one collaborative inbox for [La Suite territoriale](https://suiteterritoriale.anct.gouv.fr/).

<img src="/docs/assets/readme-screenshot.png" alt="Messages screenshot" width="100%" align="center"/>

## Why use Messages ❓

Messages is a full communication platform enabling teams to collaborate on emails through shared or personal mailboxes.

It features a [MTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent) based on [Postfix](https://www.postfix.org/), a custom [MDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_delivery_agent) built on top of [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and a frontend using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [BlockNote.js](https://www.blocknotejs.org/).

It offers a free and secure alternative to tools such as Zendesk, Outlook or Gmail.

### Familiar messaging features
* 📝 Receive, draft and send emails.
* 🧵 Smart threading
* 📎 Upload and download attachments. Also works with [Drive](https://github.com/suitenumerique/drive)!
* 📩 Import emails from MBOX or IMAP
* 🔎 Full-text search with advanced filters
* ⏳️ Asynchronous, pluggable email processing (antispam, antivirus, ...)

### Collaboration at the core
* 👥 Share any inbox with multiple users
* 🧶 Share threads with other users
* (soon) 🕶 Private messages between users
* (soon) 💎 Realtime text editing
* (soon) 👉 Assign threads to specific users

### Based on standards
* 🔑 OpenID Connect for all user accounts. Plug any identity provider, including Keycloak.
* 📬 SMTP in and out.
* ❌ No POP3 or IMAP client support, by design. We're building for the future, not the (unsecure) past!
* ✅ JMAP-inspired data model. Full support could be added.

### Self-host
* 🚀 Messages is designed to be installed on the cloud or on your own servers.


## Getting started 🔧

### Prerequisite

To test Messages on your own machine, you only need a recent version of Docker and [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install):

```shellscript
$ docker -v
  Docker version 27.5.1, build 9f9e405

$ docker compose version
  Docker Compose version v2.32.4
```

> ⚠️ You may need to run the following commands with `sudo` but this can be
> avoided by assigning your user to the `docker` group.

### Project bootstrap

The easiest way to start working on the project is to use [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

```shellscript
$ make bootstrap
```

This command builds all required containers, installs dependencies, performs
database migrations and compiles translations. It's a good idea to use this
command each time you are pulling code from the project repository to avoid
dependency-related or migration-related issues.

Your Docker services should now be up and running 🎉

You can access the project by going to <http://localhost:3000>.

You will be prompted to log in. The default credentials are:

```
email: user{1,2,3}@example.local
password: user{1,2,3}
```

This means you can use `user1@example.local / user1` for instance and switch users later to test collaboration.

In your development workflow, the main commands you should use are:

```
# Stop all containers
$ make stop

# Start all containers, without full bootstrap
$ make start

# View all available commands
$ make help
```

### Django admin

You can access the Django admin site at
[http://localhost:8071/admin](http://localhost:8071/admin).

You first need to create a superuser account:

```bash
$ make superuser
```

You can then login with email `admin@admin.local` and password `admin`.


### OpenAPI client

The frontend API client is generated with
[Orval](https://orval.dev/). It consumes the OpenAPI schema generated from the backend through 
[drf-spectacular](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The JSON OpenAPI schema is located in
`src/backend/core/api/openapi.json`.

To update the schema then the frontend API client, run:

```bash
$ make api-update
```

You can also generate the schema only with:

```bash
$ make backend-api-update
```

And the frontend API client only with:

```bash
$ make frontend-api-update
```

### Sending test emails 📨

There are a couple ways of testing the email infrastructure locally.

These examples use [swaks](https://www.jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/), a simple command-line SMTP client.

```
# First, make sure services are running
make run

# Send a test message to the MTA-out, which will then relay it to mailcatcher. Read it on http://localhost:1081/
swaks -tls --to=test@example.com --server 127.0.0.1:8587 --auth-user testuser --auth-password=testpass

# Send a test message to the MTA-in, which will relay it to the Django MDA.
# The domain must be MESSAGES_TESTDOMAIN if you want the mailbox created automatically.
# You can then read it on the frontend on http://localhost:3000/ (login as user1/user1) and reply to it there.
# The replies will then be sent through the MTA-out to the mailcatcher on http://localhost:1081/
swaks --to=user1@example.local --server 127.0.0.1:8025

```
